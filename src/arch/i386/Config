# IMPORTANT!
# 
# The use of this file to set options that affect only single object
# files is deprecated, because changing anything in this file results
# in a complete rebuild, which is slow.  All options are gradually
# being migrated to config.h, which does not suffer from this problem.
# 
# Only options that affect the entire build (e.g. overriding the $(CC)
# Makefile variable) should be placed in here.

# Config for i386 Etherboot
#
# Do not delete the tag OptionDescription and /OptionDescription
# It is used to automatically generate the documentation.
#
# @OptionDescrition@
#
#	BIOS interface options:
#
#	-DPCBIOS
#			Compile in support for the normal pcbios
#	-DLINUXBIOS
#			Compile in support for LinuxBIOS
#	-DBBS_BUT_NOT_PNP_COMPLIANT
#			Some BIOSes claim to be PNP but they don't conform
#			to the BBS spec which specifies that ES:DI must
#			point to the string $PnP on entry. This option
#			works around those. This option must be added to
#			LCONFIG.
#	-DNO_DELAYED_INT
#			Take control as soon as BIOS detects the ROM.
#			Normally hooks onto INT18H or INT19H. Use only if you
#			have a very non-conformant BIOS as it bypasses
#			BIOS initialisation of devices. This only works for
#			legacy ROMs, i.e. PCI_PNP_HEADER not defined.
#			This option was formerly called NOINT19H.
#	-DBOOT_INT18H
#			Etherboot normally hooks onto INT19H for legacy ROMs.
#			You can choose to hook onto INT18H (BASIC interpreter
#			entry point) instead. This entry point is used when
#			all boot devices have been exhausted. This option must
#			be added to LCONFIG.
#	-DCONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
#			Define this for PCI BIOSes that do not implement
#			BIOS32 or not correctly. Normally not needed.
#			Only works for BIOSes of a certain era.
#	-DCONFIG_TSC_CURRTICKS
#			Uses the processor time stamp counter instead of reading
#			the BIOS time counter.  This allows Etherboot to work
#			even without a BIOS.  This only works on late model
#			486s and above.
#	-DCONFIG_NO_TIMER2
#			Some systems do not have timer2 implemented.
#			If you have a RTC this will allow you to roughly calibrate
#			it using outb instructions.
#
#	Extended cpu options

#	-DCONFIG_X86_64	
#			Compile in support for booting x86_64 64bit binaries.
#
#	PXE loader options:
#
#	-DPXELOADER_KEEP_ALL
#			Prevent PXE loader (prefix) from unloading the
#			PXE stack.  You will want to use this if, for
#			example, you are booting via PXE-on-floppy.
#			You may want to use it under certain
#			circumstances when using the Etherboot UNDI
#			driver; these are complex and best practice is
#			not yet established.
#			
#	Obscure options you probably don't need to touch:
#
#	-DIGNORE_E820_MAP
#			Ignore the memory map returned by the E820 BIOS
#			call.  May be necessary on some buggy BIOSes.
#	-DT503_AUI
#			Use AUI by default on 3c503 cards.
#	-DFLATTEN_REAL_MODE
# 			Use 4GB segment limits when calling out to or
#			returning to real-mode code.  This is necessary to
#			work around some buggy code (e.g. OpenBSD's pxeboot)
#			that uses flat real-mode without being sufficiently
#			paranoid about the volatility of its segment limits.
